## Overview

This project is a web-based application that provides an interactive 3D visualization of celestial bodies in our solar system. Users can explore planets, their moons, and obtain relevant information about each celestial object.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The project is built using the React library for creating interactive user interfaces.

- **Three.js:** A JavaScript library used for creating 3D graphics, enabling the rendering of celestial bodies in the browser.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Used for timeline animations to enhance the user experience.

- **Material-UI:** React components for building a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

## Features

- **Planetary Exploration:** Explore detailed 3D models of planets, including information about their size, distance from the Sun, and more.

- **Moons and Labels:** The application includes moons orbiting planets, with labels providing additional information.

- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on different devices.

## Additional Information

- For detailed information about each planet, check the corresponding information panels provided in the UI.

- The application uses WebGL for rendering, and it's recommended to use a browser that supports WebGL for the best experience (like Chrome).
